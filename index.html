            <h5> Hi! I hope you didn't die from coronavirus because you be slacking on my text messages.</h5>
            <h5> I am also into Kpop and love dancing to it! I am currently a CHAD major. Ok i would like to think of myself as someone who works very hard at things that I am passionate about. I am very emotional and intuitive, and depending on my mood, I can appear differently to people. I am generally very energetic and I love to be someone who motivates others. Sometimes though, I do tend to undermine my ability or think that I don't do well enough. oop :'))</h5>

            <h5> Hey! It's me your Kuya.  </h5>
            <h5> What it is. Im a huge gamer n kinda starting to dip my feet in the rave scene. Anime n kpop are common things in my life. I LOVE to go bowling and i do some art on the side whenever i have time. Most times my friends call me a titan but that really means im just a crackhead who is lightweight at everything lol im a dirty chemical engineer. I say dirty becuz i only took this major cuz  it makes a lot of money down the line. Everybody likes money right? I mainly did it so i can build a family and have my 4 daughters n 2 boys. I have no fashion sense cuz i am commonly seen in sweats and attempting to go the gym. I would say im pretty emotional both ways. I can be loyal but also sometimes hold a grudge .-.</h5>

            <h5>Hey bitch. buckle up, im going to make this reveal suffering for you just like the rest of your years of college as a computer engineer. I would know.</h5>
            <h5> You are a nerd so you can figure this out. my name is Ben D0ver. And I love Ed sheeran. Welcome to day 1 of revealing. Here are a few songs I like: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2aTCwsN8r0lPp6ZSQpH2ek  make sure to keep this playlist saved, I will be updating it daily. Be on the lookout for clues because I will give them, you just gotta release your inner sherlock holmes. I already told you my name on day 1 and if you figured that out that would be pretty impressive because it is very hard to catch. I love joking around so hopefully you laugh or at least laugh at how bad it is. Anyways, I can't wait for our future boba runs and study sessions together! When you finish reading this message, post on facebook  and text all your kuyates, "hey ading! wyd?"</h5>

            <h3> Ading Lydia, </h3>
            <h5> I am a business management major as of right now.</h5>
            <h5> We both love Kpop, how crazy is that! I might be changing my concentration to MIS and hopefully minoring in Graphic Design. I think I am a person that is kind and caring. I am the mom of the group or my friends like to call me the dad of the gorup. I am here to support you, listen to you, and make you laugh. I would consider myself an introvert, extrovert, I enjoy hanging out with people but it sometimes drains me. I'll never get tired of you tho *heart emoji</h5>

            <h3>For Joshua,</h3>
            <h5> This is the last day. It's been a long week for me having 2 midterms and quiz while having no Wifi. It's been a struggle also
                 trying to keep this revealing week as interesting and engaging as possible for you. I made my first website which took me
                 way longer then it should have tbh, but I wanted to make it for you. You are my 4th little/ading. You have one sib in Akbayan
                 and 2 more sibs in VSA and I hope you all get along. Our line name under my grand patrick is called Lingerine. I may not be
                 the perfect kuya but know that I will be there for you and be here to listen to you. I will do my best to make sure
                 you grow to be the best person you can be and hype you up! I am very spontaneous so I will randomly ask you wyd to hang out at like 10:00pm. 
                 But I am also very busy because of the role I have in an organization and my loadwork with taking all major classes. I will 
                 always put in an effort still hang out with you and you can always call & message me. Some hints with our fam is that are known
                 to be awkward but in a good way and I love my fam. I used to be very active in Akbayan my first two years but then I stopped
                 being active because I got busy with something else. I did PCN & Friendship Games my first year. I also love to vlog so you 
                 might be able to find my videos on Youtube hehe. I love you and I can't wait to meet you on Zoom LOL and also in person.
